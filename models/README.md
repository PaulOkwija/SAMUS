# Models Directory Structure and Source Mapping

This directory contains the code for each SAM-based implementation used in this benchmark. Below is a mapping of each folder to its corresponding original repository, along with a brief description.

## Folder Mapping

| Folder Name                  | Description                                      | Original Repository Link |
|------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|
| `segment_anything/`          | Official Meta AI Segment Anything Model (SAM)    | [facebookresearch/segment-anything](https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything) |
| `samed/`                     | Customized Segment Anything Model for Medical Image Segmentation | [hitachinsk/SAMed](https://github.com/hitachinsk/SAMed) |
| `segment_anything_samus/`    | SAMUS: SAM for ultrasound segmentation           | [xianlin7/SAMUS](https://github.com/xianlin7/SAMUS) |

## Notes

- Each folder contains the adapted code from its respective repository.
